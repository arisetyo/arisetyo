# Halo! Hello! Salut! 👋

I am **Arie M. Prasetyo**, a senior development manager and software engineer. My tenure includes Education Horizons (in Australia), GoPlay (GoTo group), & Zenius Education. Currently I am embarking on a new journey, getting back to my roots in consultancy. While still doing creative development and learning new technologies on the weekends.

- 🏢 My responsibilities require me to work a lot with Confluence, JIRA, Notion, LucidChart, spreadsheets, etc. You know, management stuff.
- But I still love to code!
- 🔭 Most of my career I code with JavaScript. At the moment in my spare time I make stuff with CSS & Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently want to learn more on OpenGL Shading Language & data visualisation.
- 🔬 This is due to my interest in the web as a platform for art and information
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to develop web games using the Adobe Flash framework. Man, those were the days...

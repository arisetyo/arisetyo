# Halo! Hello! Salut! 👋

I am **Arie M. Prasetyo**, currently the Head of Engineering at Zenius Education, Indonesia.

- 🏢 My responsibilities require me to work a lot with Notion, Confluence, LucidChart, spreadsheets, etc. You know, management stuff.
- But I still love to code!
- 🔭 Mostly I code with JavaScript (React, Next, Node, Nest) and SCSS (vanilla flavor, the best!)
- 🌱 I’m currently want to learn more about data visualisation, using the wonderful D3 (data-driven document) library
- 🔬 This is due to my interest in data visualisation and UI/X engineering. If you do too, let's chat!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to develop web games using the Adobe Flash framework. Man, those were the days...

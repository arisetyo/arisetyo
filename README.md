# Halo! Hello! Salut! 👋

I am **Arie M. Prasetyo**, currently the Tech Lead - Web at GoPlay Indonesia.

- 🏢 My responsibilities require me to work a lot with Confluence, LucidChart, spreadsheets, etc. But I still love to code.
- 🔭 Mostly I code with JavaScript (React, Next, Node) and CSS (vanilla flavor, the best!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data visualisation, using the wonderful D3 (data-driven document) library
- 🔬 This is due to my interest in data visualisation and UI/X engineering. If you do too, let's chat!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to develop web games using the Adobe Flash framework. Man, those were the days...
